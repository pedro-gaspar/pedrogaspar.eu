A couple months ago, scrolling in my Twitter feed, I came across a tweet from José Valim, the Brazilian developer rockstar 👨‍🎤 I greatly admire.

I immediately started feeling [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out) again...

A couple of years ago, the first time I read a bit about it, I felt really curious.
Coming from a Ruby on Rails background, it seemed incredible. All the goodies of Rails and none of the weaknesses of Ruby. The syntax looked familiar, and the rendering times were displayed with a character I had never seen in the terminal...

> &micro; seconds ... micro ... MICRO SEEEECONDS 😱

After attending a Ruby conference, I started to learn a bit about it, and for that, I followed a path similar to Rails. First, learn the framework and then learn the language. So I bought **Programming Phoenix** and started speed reading it. With the help of the book, I built a couple of small projects and was really enjoying it a lot. 😍

![Programming Phoenix](https://pragprog.com/titles/phoenix14/programming-phoenix-1-4/phoenix14_hu6d5b8b63a4954cb696e89b39f929331b_925363_500x0_resize_q75_box.jpg)

After tinkering a bit, I never felt really comfortable with the language and doing things from scratch. At first, I thought it just had a steeper learning curve. Moreover, it was a different paradigm from object-oriented, which I had been using all my developer life, to functional programming.

Well, in fact, reading a book and doing some tutorial copy-pastes doesn’t really make you learn something. It just gives the illusion of it. So I lacked experience in developing _real-world TM_ applications and needed to get more experience.

> Even though I didn't know why, it felt right.❤️

However, trying to advocate it in the place I worked was a frustrating experience. So I switched gears and joined a startup using Elixir in some internal projects. But I was primarily working in front-end land with React & Redux while there. One of the goals of picking that job was to have the opportunity to gain knowledge and experience with Elixir, but I never had the chance there. 😞

Four years later, I find myself looking back and regretting not pushing myself to work in Elixir full-time. I miss the fun times of reading and learning about it. The sense of a quest, of finding a hidden treasure.

As I’m getting older, I notice that even though age doesn’t bring wisdom, it does provide some clarity. You realize that your days on Earth aren’t unlimited, so better start living them to the fullest. 💪

Pragmatic Dave Thomas has a pretty good piece of advice:

> The most important rule:<br/>
> Explore, make mistakes, and try wild things.<br/>
> And most of all, _have fun_.

So this is not a new year's resolution but an upcoming life goal that I need to focus on.

> **I want to have fun working full-time using Elixir 🥳**.

I need to **really learn Elixir and have a lot more experience** for that to happen anytime soon.

Like all treasures, the path to discovering them isn’t clear. It requires a lot of research, learning, and failing along the way. And…

I’ll use this blog as a diary containing all my findings required to face the final challenge with confidence to choose wisely. Drink from the right cup, the holy grail of Elixir knowledge 🏆.

> _Prof. Jones_ **“Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.”**<br/> _Indiana_ **“What final challenge?”**<br/> _Prof. Jones_ **“Three devices of such lethal cunning.”**<br/> _Indiana_ **“Booby traps?”**<br/> _Prof. Jones_ **“Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through them in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.”**<br/> _Indiana_ **“Well, what are they?”**<br/> _Indiana_ **“Can't you remember?”**<br/> _Prof. Jones_ **“I wrote them down in my diary so that I wouldn't have to remember.”**
