Break in iex with unmatched quotes or parens without exiting
{{< /alert >}}

Sometimes, when you forget to close a quote, double quote, or brackets, it will continue to create new lines when you press enter.

You can exit by pressing `Ctrl+c` twice, but you will leave the interactive shell.

If you want to stop the statement, you are inserting just add `#iex:break`. It will error out, but you will still be in the shell.

```sh
iex(1)> IO.puts("dssdsda
...(1)> asdasdsda
...(1)> sadsadsda
...(1)> #iex:break
** (TokenMissingError) iex:1: incomplete expression
```
