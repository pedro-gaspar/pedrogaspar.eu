If you have `docker` and `docker-compose` you don't necessarily need to install Elixir from scratch. There's an easy way, you can let containers do the heavy lifting.

Just create a new app, for instance:

```sh
$ mix new elixir_docker
```

Then create a docker file based on the Elixir image:

**Dockerfile**

```sh
FROM bitwalker/alpine-elixir:latest

WORKDIR /app

COPY mix.exs .

CMD mix deps.get
```

Then a docker-compose file. This will be useful later on when you add more pieces to your system like a database.

**docker-compose.yml**

```sh
version: '3.6'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    environment:
      MIX_ENV: dev
    volumes:
      - .:/app
```

And then you just need to build your container and run it.

```sh
$ docker-compose build
$ docker-compose run app iex -S mix
```

And just like that, you have a running `iex`.

Well, depending on your network to download the images and if you already have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed.

But you get my point üòè

And you are ready to go. For now, I'll keep using Elixir locally on my Ubuntu, you can call me old school, but this is surely a great alternative.
