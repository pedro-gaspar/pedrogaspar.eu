👨‍💻 Software Engineer 👪 Father 🧙 Geek 👨‍🏫 Learner

![Me](/images/me.jpeg)

Hello, my friend, my name is Pedro. 👋

I'm a Software Engineer by trade, and especially by heart ♥. I've got the traits of _Bob the Builder_ because I love building stuff 👷.

I've been around planet Earth for quite some time now.

I'm the father of two small 👧👧 that I'm trying to help grow and become amazing human beings. Married to the best wife in the galaxy 🌕.

😴 Sleeping nowadays is my main hobby. Being a father takes you years of sleep, so you have to catch up.

👨‍🎓 I studied Electrical Engineering and Computers in the Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto, in the beautiful city of Oporto, Portugal.

🏠 I live in a small town near Oporto, Portugal, called Penafiel.

👷 I work at Beyond Pricing, with a bunch of great people, helping to build the best tool for Vacation Rental in the whole world and nearby planets.

🚀 I'm currently learning and writing about Elixir during the night
